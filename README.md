This is for my UNSW Big Data Management assignments and labs

* ass1 = Using Apache MapReduce with Java to "compute the average length of words starting with each letter".

* ass2 = Using HBase with Java to bulk load comments for Problem1 (HBaseBulkLoadComments.java) and to then to write the output of a MapReduce calculation for Problem1 (ReadHBaseComments.java).

* ass3 = Using Spark with Scala for Data Analytics.

* ass 4 = Using MapReduce with Java again to reverse a graph for Problem 1 (ReverseGraph.java) and to do iterative read/writes to calculate "Single-source shortest path" of a graph that was executed on AWS EMR for Problem 2 (SingleSourceSP.java).
